                Chris is an exceptional tech lead and a natural leader. His drive for continuous improvement, for excellence, 
                for quality, for knowledge sharing, for team harmony, for best practices and for doing the right thing have 
                defined our team's culture and have a constant impact to the competencies of this team. Most importantly, he 
                has taught the team by example how to do critical thinking, why it is important to understand the value behind 
                everything they are working on and to be able to reason for it. Chris will succeed on everything he does and 
                I am confident he will soon be one of WKâ€™s most influential leaders.

                Chris was assigned to our office to work as a consultant on revamping the College's website through
                Computer Information Services (CIS). During the time he consulted for the College, Chris was very 
                attentive and in tune with the needs and wants of our office. At times, he was placed in difficult
                situations dealing with what we wanted aesthetically, and knowing professionally what was realistic.
                He had the skills and attitude to mesh both to make sure everyone was pleased. I did not have the 
                knowledge necessary to always explain what we wanted. Chris knew this and took great care in explaining
                all the options. It was a complete joy to have interactions with an IT professional who knew that I was
                confused and explained things to me on my level. The project continued successfully and the College
                raved on his expertise and service oriented attitude.

                Chris proved himself as an exceptionally talented analyst. He is super-intelligent with
                performances consistently exceeded what were expected from his job title. As his immediate supervisor,
                I recall giving him high rankings and remarks in his annual reviews, and recommended a promotion
                shortly after he began working for us. I consider Chris in the top 3% category of all analysts I have
                supervised over my 25 years as a Senior IT Manager. Chris not only excels as a keen observer, a quick
                learner, a self-starter with a sharp analytical mind; he also shows "leadership,", uncommon for a young
                individual his age. Chris is extremely knowledgeable and savvy with new technologies; he possesses superb
                oral and written skills that enable him to express himself well.

                            <p>
                                As an Associate Director for Platform Engineering, Chris manages teams for greenfield and brownfield 
				projects. Chrisâ€™ group consists of 30 overall personell, including managers. Platform Engineering is 
				responsible for development platforms leveraged by multiple line-of-business products developed by
				different teams within our division. Chris' primary responsibilities include technical and SDLC 
				coaching and mentoring for his teams (and others), assessing process needs to help keep our Agile 
				(Scrum) teams efficient and unburdened by red tape, working with stakeholders and across different 
				teams to ensure smooth engagement and delivery. Additionally, Chris managed the Dev DBA team, an 
				operations-style group responsible for developer consulting and management of SQL database build and 
				deployment.

				<h6>IDaaS - Identity as a Service</h6>
                            <p>
                                Chris has successfully led his identity team to complete the delivery
                                of the new greenfield Identity Platform (IDaaS) and successfully drive the onboarding of all customers 
                                for two major TAA products - CCH Axcess and CCH GfX. IDaaS is an OIDC compliant 
                                identity broker that centralizes identity management into a single platform to reduce waste of 
                                repeated development of authentication providers and security hardening. The IDaaS platform was developed
                                as an Active-Passive service on Azure Service Fabric, leveraging Azure SQL, Azure API Management, 
                                Azure Service Bus, and CosmosDB. Chris is leading his team to migrate from Service Fabric 
				to Azure App Services and to Active-Active availability by Q2 2020. 
                            </p>
				<h6>Identity Store</h6>
			    	<p>
					Supporting IDaaS and authentication, the identity store is a new security-critical service focused on managing the basic personal information
					and credentials for users of our TAA NA portfolio of applications. Chris led a newly formed identity store team 
					of contractors and FTEs to deliver its first production release by year end 2019. Development started
					from scratch in September 2019 and completed phase 1 in December 2019. The team had been assembled between
					July and August 2019. The team is continuing to work on phase 2 in Q1 2020. 
				</p>
                            <p>
                                Additionally, Chris led the TAA Axcess software development organization thru an Azure 
                                data migration project, where 100% of our workload (with data) was successfully migrated from 
                                our private cloud provider to Azure. The project involved identifying the software products affected by
                                the migration, identifying their data sources, identifying the target workload within those products,
                                and then plan how to synchronize that data from our private cloud to Azure, then switch traffic to Azure. 
                                This 18-month project was completed in three phases, where each phase took one month to synchronize data, and a 24 hour maintenance window to do the 
                                final synchronization and traffic moves for our target workload. All migrations completed within our 
                                scheduled maintenance window, with customers having a significantly better experience in Azure immediately 
                                post-migration than customers that still remain in our private cloud provider. 
                            </p>
			    <p>
			        TAA Axcess was limited in the features and performance of the application as it was running with SQL 2012 
				    compatibility mode. Chris led the Dev DBA team and worked across the software and IT Ops organization 
				    to plan and execute a major 7-month project to upgrade the infrastructure and software to SQL 2017 
				    compatibility mode. The project completed in December 2019.

                            <p>
                                Chris led the Release Management Task Force, a group chartered by our CTO to revisit the TAA Axcess 
                                monolithic deployment strategy, to identify a vision, goals, and KPIs to help improve our software release
                                process. This vision and goals are rooted in software industry standards, including separating software deployment from release, 
                                accellerating the frequency of deployments, completely automating our deployments, and bolstering the reliability
                                with the end goal being zero-downtime software deployments. Within 6 months, Chris led the task force to identify 
                                a roadmap with clear technical direction that map back to the vision and goals, and is working with the business to prioritize and begin
                                executing.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As a part of the Release Management Task Force and Azure Migration projects, Chris has helped rebuild the relationship between development
                                and operations. As a result, Chris has been collaborating with operations to define a path for DevOps transformation. Cultural
                                changes are currently underway, with the focus on moving us from reactive to proactive planning thru 
                                enabling development leadership to communicate quarterly roadmaps relevant to operations and adding feedback
                                loops to strengthen the operability of our deliverables.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Finally, Chris' passion for culture led him to start the func() - our internal fun c()mmittee - to help 
                                revitalize the office culture and bring siloed teams together to help break down barriers. This was done
                                thru driving a new weekly event dubbed Thirsty Thursday, a new Fall Festival, Halloween activities, Diwali,
                                and other cultural and social activities.

                            <p>
                                As the Audit Tech Lead, Chris led his team to develop a greenfield, multi-tenant cloud-based Audit
                                Software-as-a-Service using microservices architecture on Azure Service Fabric. Chris held the role 
                                of application architect and technical lead. As application architect, he spent time working with the
                                Chief Architects' Office to understand reference architecture goals, proposed designs to meet the needs
                                of Global Audit, and created design plans for his team to understand the technical needs in order
                                to estimate work. As the technical lead, Chris led the team to execute successfully through work item 
                                management and task delegation, ensuring proper technical implementation thru code reviews, and 
                                coaching and mentoring junior developers to grow their technical competencies and close technical gaps.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Chris helped lead the effort to introduce continuous delivery within TAA Axcess. As a greenfield project, Chris
                                setup the continuous integration and continuous delivery pipeline in Visual Studio Team Services and provided
                                feedback and guidance to the Chief Architects' Office on our ultimate implementation. This
                                effort greatly improved the velocity of the Audit development team and continues to be referenced as the
                                standard for continuous delivery for projects in the organization. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Chris was tapped as a strategic resource for helping to identify quality issues both for greenfield and 
                                legacy products within Axcess. Chris helped to do this by setting up SonarQube and adding analysis to the
                                continuous integration pipeline for products. Chris closed the gap by training the global organization on 
                                the benefits and how to use SonarQube.

                                As the Audit Tech Lead, Chris led his team to develop a greenfield, multi-tenant cloud-based Audit
                                Software-as-a-Service using microservices architecture on Azure Service Fabric. Chris held the role 
                                of application architect and technical lead. As application architect, he spent time working with the
                                Chief Architects' Office to understand reference architecture goals, proposed designs to meet the needs
                                of Global Audit, and created design plans for his team to understand the technical needs in order
                                to estimate work. As the technical lead, Chris led the team to execute successfully through work item 
                                management and task delegation, ensuring proper technical implementation thru code reviews, and 
                                coaching and mentoring junior developers to grow their technical competencies and close technical gaps.

                                Chris helped lead the effort to introduce continuous delivery within TAA Axcess. As a greenfield project, Chris
                                setup the continuous integration and continuous delivery pipeline in Visual Studio Team Services and provided
                                feedback and guidance to the Chief Architects' Office on our ultimate implementation. This
                                effort greatly improved the velocity of the Audit development team and continues to be referenced as the
                                standard for continuous delivery for projects in the organization.

                                Chris was tapped as a strategic resource for helping to identify quality issues both for greenfield and 
                                legacy products within Axcess. Chris helped to do this by setting up SonarQube and adding analysis to the
                                continuous integration pipeline for products. Chris closed the gap by training the global organization on 
                                the benefits and how to use SonarQube.

                    Windows provides its own level of challenges, but UNIX administration is largely a different beast.
                    Chris has administered UNIX systems in a wide variety of capacities, including creating a web hosting
                    platform at multiple projects, performing integration with Windows Active Directory, and providing
                    highly scalable and available failover systems in small and large datacenter environments.

                                Despite providing a significant amount of software engineering support, almost 50% of Chris'
                                responsibilities with Quicktate include dev/ops on our UNIX systems. Chris has moved the project
                                from inscalable bare-metal systems to highly available, more performant virtual infrastructure
                                hosted in Softlayer's cloud service. Though the original design and plan was to move to Amazon's
                                EC2, the cost of support in Amazon was not sustainable, leaving the team with Softlayer. During 
                                the transition, Chris implemented puppet to help automate the dynamic scaling of our web application
                                and front-end web servers to handle the roughly 15-20 million weekly HTTP requests and the 2 million
                                weekly voice transcription requests the site sees.

                                A requirement for our SharePoint 2010 environment was to enable users to perform
                                self-service site collection creation following a workflow established by compliance.
                                Custom WCF services were developed and deployed within SharePoint 2010 to provide 
                                data validation endpoints as well as endpoints for beginning the site collection creation
                                process. These WCF services are invoked from the Custom ASP.Net forms crafted to guide

                                In preparation for the rollout of SharePoint 2010, compliance requirements dictated that
                                permissions and entitlements management must be tightly managed. To ease the burden of 
                                site administrators, a WPF application was built to provide a friendly UI for this 
                                entitlements management. The WPF application consumed a set of claims-enabled WCF services
                                (deployed within SharePoint) which performed entitlements and permissions lookup, 
                                entitlement requests, permissions modifications, and reporting.

                                since 2010. A large part of what Chris has done includes drafting and implementing the layouts of the various
                                views for the AgileDotNet web site. This is done to help the marketing team focus solely on content
                                without the need to understand HTML or CSS. In 2013, Chris revamped the design and logo of the event web site 
                                in response to the wholescale rebranding and revitalization of the event.

                                Upon joining the firm's SharePoint engineering team, the team was operating in
                                chaos mode, unable to deliver SharePoint for two and a half years.
                                I coached the team on agile values and principles and 
                                enabled them to complete the work in-progress and release to production in less 
                                than three months. Immediately following the release, we developed a backlog of
                                tasks for SharePoint 2013 and delivered the first release in four weeks.

                                When appointed the technical lead role of the team, continued to adapt the agile

                                within the firm. Successfully adapted Scrum practices to dovetail with the firm's
                                SDLC expectations and practices. Continued to adapt our agile model to best manage
                                projects with immovable deadlines due to external regulatory constraints.

                                Enabled the team to become self-organizing and take charge of relative effort estimations.
